## 💡 **What is MATLAB?**

MATLAB (**MAT**rix **LAB**oratory) is a high-performance language for technical computing. It integrates computation, visualization, and programming in an easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are expressed in mathematical notation.

### ✅ **Key Features:**

- Matrix-based language — ideal for linear algebra and numerical computation.
- Built-in functions for data analysis, visualization, and engineering tasks.
- Wide range of toolboxes for specialized applications (e.g., Control Systems, Signal Processing).
- User-friendly interface with script editor, command window, and workspace browser.
